# What is this page?

This page is a living document that outlines the community guidelines for Quilt commmunity. While those guidelines aren't authoritative,
they set a standard for what we expect from our community members and staff.

Authoritative policies can be found in our [RFCs](/about/faq#whats-an-rfc-how-do-they-work), along with our [Code of Conduct](/community/code-of-conduct) and [rules](/community/rules).
If a guideline is in conflict with one of these, that document takes precedence over the guidelines.

	# Reporting a staff member

	If you feel the need to report a member of staff, the right person to contact will depend on their roles:
	- Developer: Contact ModMail or a Moderator directly
	- Moderator: Contact a Manager or ModMail
	- Manager: Contact a member of the Administrative Board or another Manager
	- Administrative Board: Contact a Manager or another member of the Administrative Board
</Message>

	# Who can see a ModMail thread?

	ModMail threads are, in most cases, only seen by Moderators and Community Managers. However, we may choose to share a thread with the Administrative Board on request,
	for oversight purposes.

	Application threads will also be seen by the Administrative Board and Community Team, as they are a part of the application process.

	We may also choose to share a stripped down version of the thread with the Community Team, with any personal information redacted, if required as part of an
	action against a member of the staff.

	If we would like to share a thread further, we will ask for your permission first. Please note that bad faith threads are exempt from this rule.

	# Food Policy

	To avoid stigmatizing food, conversations about food and drinks are allowed anywhere in our community space. We ask you to not request
	food content warnings, but you are free to content warn your own content as you wish.

	We recognize that this policy may not be ideal for everyone, but we believe it is the approach that is most inclusive of our community and inline with our values.

	# Syncing bans from Discord to other platforms

	We take a very firm approach to moderation on Discord, as it is a social space before anything else. However, we can take a more lax approach
	when it comes to other platforms to not block users entirely from voicing their opinions on Quilt's development or get support.

	As such, we will sync bans from Discord to other platforms under any of the following conditions:
	- The activity of the banned user in another platform would make vulnerable users feel uncomfortable and unable to interact in that platform.
	- The user has been banned for spamming or trolling.
	- We do not want our projects to be associated with that user.

	# Who can use PluralKit?

	PluralKit is reserved for accessibility purpose. We allow any good faith usage of that tool under that condition.

	For example:
	- Allowed: Using PluralKit to distinguish between members of a plural system, endogenic or traumagenic, or questioning.
	- Allowed: Using PluralKit to swap between different pronouns or personas.
	- Disallowed: Using PluralKit to impersonate someone else.
	- Disallowed: Using PluralKit for roleplaying.

	# Creating seasonal branding

	While we would love to have more seasonal branding showcasing all kind of cultures, we don't have the resources to do so by ourselves.
	As such, you are welcome to talk to us about contributing or commissioning seasonal branding for your own culture.

	Please note that we may not use your branding if you don't get an explicit approval from us before starting to work.

	# Hosting a Minecraft server in Quilt

	We allow hosting Minecraft servers inside Quilt's community space, under some conditions:
	- The server name cannot contain Quilt's name or any of its projects' names.
	- Whitelist must be enabled.
	- The server staff must be able to provide the Discord account name of a player on request from the moderators.
	The server staff will be held responsible for any violations from a player they can't identify.
	- The server must follow our [Code of Conduct](/community/code-of-conduct), [rules](/community/rules) and the [Minecraft EULA](https://account.mojang.com/documents/minecraft_eula).
	The server staff will be held responsible for any lack of enforcement of these rules.

	# Navigating conflicts of interest

	We define conflicts of interest as situations where a staff member's personal interests may influence their actions in a way that is detrimental to the community.
	Those situations may include, but are not limited to:
	- Being in a romantic relationship with another community member.
	- Working with another community member in a professional capacity.
	- Being a family member of another community member.

	If you are in a situation where you believe you have a conflict of interest when voicing your opinion over a situation, please state your conflict before doing so
	or abstain from voicing your opinion.

	We also expect you to abstain from a vote in which you have a conflict of interest if you can't judge the situation fairly.

	# Staff activity requirements

	Due to the nature of some positions, we require staff members to be active within the community:
	- Moderators: We believe that a Moderator must stay in touch with the community to be able to moderate effectively.
	- Community Managers: Similarly, we believe that a Community Manager must stay in touch with the community to be able to
	manage it effectively. Additionally, Managers hold sensitive permissions over the platform, we therefore would like to avoid dormant
	accounts with access to those permissions for security reasons.
	- Administrative Board members: Due to the limited number of seats, we require board members to periodically carry tasks to avoid
	stalling out the project.
